**14 Apr:**

I was only just directed by a classmate to the part in the course description detailing that we need to maintain this repository. Sincere apologies for starting my commits late, I will back-date my project history through the semester.

**Week 1:**

I wanted to do a comparison of synthetic controls of a large-scale intervention (which I would do) and prior RCTs on the same intervention, to see if they align.

I spent a lot of time searching for good quality public data, but found it tricky. There was a lot of general data available for education, healthcare, climate etc. But the tricky requirement here was that I needed
- An RCT done on the intervention
- A subsequent implementation of the exact policy tested
- Monitoring and evaluation of the specific variables that the RCT studied

Point 3 in particular was difficult, because without this the comparison of Synthetic Controls to the RCT may not be useful.

**Weeks 2-3:**

I spent a ton of time getting data on education in India and malaria initiatives in Sub-Sahara.

The India education stats were in particular super exciting. In Econometrics+Causality there is all this buzz recently about RCT-driven policy interventions. 2019 Nobel Laureates (called the "randomistas") pioneered this movement in development policy and are personal heros.

They established distributing LLIN-bednets for malaria prevention was one of the most cost-effective interventions (in terms of Quality-Adjusted Life Years added per $ spent). They also established an educational intervention called Teaching At the Right Level (TARL).

RCTs in Northern Indian states were very promising and they rolled it out. I unfortunately hit snags with the data:
- Turns out the RCTs used a TARL policy that was materially different from the scaled-up version
- The RCTs measured improvements in specific skills like numeracy and reading through curated tests
- While government data proved excellent (they even had district level tags for female toilet availability!) they don't have subject level performance, just aggregated dropout rates, pass-fail etc.

This would be my back-up if I find no other dataset.
